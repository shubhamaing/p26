Homemade Vanilla Cake recipe ingredients
Butter and flour two 9-inch cake pans.

Flouring the pans
Combine sugar, flour, salt, and baking powder in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix until the dry ingredients are combined.

Mixing the dry ingredients
With the mixer on the lowest speed, add the butter one chunk at a time, and blend until the mixture forms a grainy consistency, between 30 seconds and 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl and paddle with a rubber spatula.

Adding the butter
Add vanilla extract and, with the mixer on low, slowly pour in the milk. Stop and scrape, and mix for another minute.

Adding the wet ingredients
Add the first egg, and mix on medium-low until incorporated; add the second egg and do the same. Mix until fluffy, about 30 seconds, then scrape down the bowl.

Batter blended with eggs
Pour the batter into the prepared pans and give each one a couple of solid taps on the countertop to release any air bubbles. Transfer pans to the oven.

Batter in pans
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a crumb or two attached. (You can start testing at 30 minutes because it's better to check too soon than to overbake.) The tops will be golden brown, the edges will pull away from the sides of the pan, and the cakes will spring back when you touch them.

Baked vanilla cakes
Cool the cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then loosen the edges by running a knife along the sides of the pan; turn the cakes out onto the racks and cool for at least 1 hour before frosting.​

Frost and enjoy.
